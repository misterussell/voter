# Build the Band!

  - SPA that allows users to vote for specific musicians that they would like to see at a specific venue

## Planning

  - Agile project management was applied (in a flexible form) to the planning process for this project.
  - User stories were drafted for the key components that would allow the project to be completed within the specified time frames.
    - after user-stories were designed base level components were planned out for each view/component/page
    - In addition to listing out the sub-components time tracking requirements were applied for each step.  

## Testing

  - Base Requirements: Collection/Model methods `incomplete: ajax interference will not allow for testing on side effect changes from within success functions`
    - I had anticipated being able to test side affects by false triggering ajax requests, but without the server side-responses I am unable to reach the success callbacks.
  - Learning Goal: xhr requests `incomplete`

## Process

  - Project Management Tool - Trello // For logging user-stories and stages of completion
  - All styling was left to the end of the project to ensure base requirements for functionality/methods
